# Kaggle-challenge
Comments sentiment classification


Kaggle Comptetition challenge - 

Given  - large number of Wikipedia comments dataset have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
insult
identity_hate

in this project I created a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.

File descriptions
train.csv - the training set, contains comments with their binary labels

test.csv - the test set, to predict the toxicity probabilities for these comments.

test_labels.csv - labels for the test data; value of -1 indicates it was not used for scoring; (Note: file added after competition close!)
